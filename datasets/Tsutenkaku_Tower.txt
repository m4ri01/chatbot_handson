Tsutenkaku Tower: a central landmark in this early 20th-century entertainment district
The first incarnation of the tower went up in 1912, connecting to an adjacent amusement park via ropeway. At the time, its 64-meter height made it the tallest in all of Asia. After the war, local volunteers rebuilt the tower to a 100-meter height, installing bright neon lights that change color with the seasons.
Planning your journey
Tsutenkaku and Shinsekai together make a must-visit destination and can fill two to three hours of your schedule. Consider making a full day of it by visiting the adjacent Tennoji neighborhood , home to Abeno Harukas, the tallest building in Japan.
